  topic = fix,feat, tech
    - fix, when you're fixing a bug
    - feat, when you implement a new feature or improve/change a feature public API
    - tech, when you work solely on a pure tech subject, like CI, performances, etc... (if you're not sure use feat topic)
  subject = name of the functionality you worked on
  Issue-ID = associated issue ticket ID when there is one

  Examples:
    tech(CI): [#1] Add automation workflow
    feat(identity): [#10] Add API to access objects by id
    fix(CoreData): Fixed crash when storing data
